The aliens are really coming. Who are you? What color? But they are all people on earth. Is it different because of different skin colors? I just want to say: These people are stupid. If you want to evolve from the perspective of evolution, the yellowest person who goes the farthest should evolve to the highest level, but this is xiaBB（瞎BB：There is no basis for talking nonsense）, without any theoretical support, and there is no practical evidence to support it, because humans have been married to each other even in ancient times. In fact, although the genetic ratio of other regions is extremely low, it is still included. The true so-called pure blood does not exist, so these racially discriminating people have no reason to believe that they are superior to others. In the event of this insulting incident, it was after the completion of the game, that is to say, the player was expanding the dissatisfaction during the game. Of course, this person is usually estimated to be a person who is consciously hostile to China. Then I want to say that China owes you? Rape your mother? On this earth, many people are unfairly hostile to China. China does not owe you. On the contrary, from the historical record, you are owing to China and owe the Chinese. Until modern society, there will still be incidents of slaughtering Chinese people for various reasons: because Chinese people are diligent, they will save money; so far these people or countries still have not apologized to China and the Chinese, and compensation for survivors. . Therefore, the Chinese are sensitive, vulnerable, and vulnerable to anger in this regard. (The Japanese can't understand this very much, but if he/she was born in China and lived in this environment, I can understand it in the end. After all, there are old people who used to invade and rob the Japanese invaders in the past. , passed down from generation to generation.)\n\n\nI am very disappointed with the official handling, so bad reviews, after all, Steam, as a global game sales platform, your words and deeds will guide the players' words and deeds. If you do not punish such people today, then the future will be more Similar incidents will occur, and not only will there be abuses, but other discriminatory incidents, perhaps insulting, insulting, and humiliating women, will be because you are not paying enough attention to discrimination. You should make a treatment that suits your own positioning. V agency as an operator and operator should pay more attention to this matter.\n\nMoreover, I am very worried that your handling will result in our players not being able to connect to STEAM in the future. Although the Chinese government can't control your decision, we are very easy on the wall. Once you need to overturn the wall, your sales will only be ok. After all, it is now much harder for China to turn over the wall than before. Moreover, China is a country where social opinion tends to be hostile to the game as a whole. Whether it is a government official or an ordinary citizen, most people are aware of this game as a scourge of cognition. Various games and game development companies set up. There are more rules and regulations than you are in foreign countries. As a game sales platform, you should not encourage the hostility of the game to continue to expand in China, which will make it difficult for Chinese gamers to be embarrassed.\n\nAfter the game, for whatever reason, the publication of discriminatory remarks shows that this athlete does not have a good attitude as an athlete. He should cancel his qualifications or ban the game and let him take responsibility for his inappropriate speech. . Anyone who makes a mistake should be punished.", "username": "翱岚祝融/Aolan Zhurong"}

For most Chinese Steam users, Dota2 is the reason why we downloaded this app five years ago, then for the first time in our life, we realized there are so many amazing games here, and we spent our money on them, from GTA5 to PUBG. Dota2 is the enlightment of us, and that's why so many bad reviews came from loyal players who have played for thousands of hours, just because Valve didn't respect our love in the game. It's hard to believe that a pro player would make such blatant racist remarks in international competitions, what would be the consequences if they did that at the Olympics games? Chinese people aren't stupid, we all know what you're gonna say under ♥♥♥♥♥, even if you tried to cover it up.\n\nDota2 is my favorite game, and I personally believe it's the most fun game ever. Even though I don't have that much time to play it, I still pay attention to every major game. I have to give it a bad review today because I'm so disappointed to see Valve didn't show appropriate respect to my five-year love and my money spent on this game, which has been proved countless times by countless Chinese players, we deserve that respect.\n\nValve不明白Dota2在中国玩家心目中的重要性，对于大部分中国玩家来说，Dota2是我们最开始了解和下载Steam的原因，我们才知道原来这里有这么多好玩的游戏，才有了之后的GTA5和PUBG。所以Dota2几乎是我们正版游戏的启蒙，这也是为什么这么多玩了上千小时的老玩家给差评的原因，因为Valve并没有尊重我们对于这款游戏的热爱。很难相信一个职业玩家在国际赛事上如此公然地发表种族歧视言论，如果是在奥运会比赛上发表这样的言论，他会受到什么样的惩罚？中国人不蠢，傻逼都知道你打那么多爱心是想说什么，欲盖弥彰罢了。\nDota2是我最爱的游戏，也是我觉得最好玩的游戏，即便我现在没有太多时间去玩，我还是会关注每一场重要的比赛。但是我还是要给予差评，因为Valve没有对我的热爱和金钱给予相对等的尊重——而这份尊重早已被无数路人和职业选手证明，中国人配得上这份尊重。\n\nCN DOTA BEST DOTA", "username": "别问，无敌"}

They called the Russian \"maozi\"(insulting with their hairy bodies), the Caucasian \"baipizhu\" or white *** pigs(insulting with skin color), the Japanese \"guizi\"(insulting as they are ghosts), and the Southeast Asian \"houzi\"(insulting as they are monkeys). And that same racism is intolerable to me and to everyone!!!!!!! If you are asking for respecting, you have to respect others and respect yourself first.  They supposed that Valve should be responsible for this incident and abused every other race. They tried to threaten Valve through massive negative comments (like refusing to use steam or giving up Dota2), and after Valve released their announcement, they were not satisfied with it and kept complaining. That literally looks like a baby rage. \n    I'm a Chinese myself, and I've addressed my view on racism and abusing in some Chinese forum, and got attacked by those Chinese haters as well. Actually, I believe that most of us aim at the same game(except these god damn haters), we all want to build a friendly, equal and anti-racism community, and we all love this game. \n    For those who made trouble, I could tell that they deserve it. But for the rest, we also deserve a better community. I hope Valve could clarify their guide lines and rules of the rating system and may possibly deleted these raged comments. \n   Let's leave these haters and enjoy some Dota !\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                         Parren\n\n   [spoiler] Come on 7.20 I know you are coming.

Even with these enhancements, the best way to play Dota2 will always be with a team of four friends.\n\nI would say that it probably won’t suit you if you’re looking to play casually. There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount.

More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (八九民运). The protests were forcibly suppressed after the government declared martial law. In what became known in the West as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with automatic rifles and tanks killed at least several hundred demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated variously from 180 to 10,454.[1][4]\n\nSet against a backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. The students called for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, though they were loosely organized and their goals varied.[5][6] At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.[7]\n\nAs the protests developed, the authorities veered back and forth between conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.[8] By May, a student-led hunger strike galvanized support for the demonstrators around the country and the protests spread to some 400 cities.[9] Ultimately, China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and other Communist Party elders believed the protests to be a political threat, and resolved to use force.[10][11] Communist Party authorities declared martial law on May 20, and mobilized as many as 300,000 troops to Beijing.[9]\n\nThe Chinese government was condemned internationally for the use of force against the protestors. Western countries imposed economic sanctions and arms embargoes.[12] China's government initially condemned the protests as a counter-revolutionary riot, and criticized other nations.[13][14] It made widespread arrests of protesters and their supporters, suppressed other protests around China, expelled foreign journalists, strictly controlled coverage of the events in the domestic press, strengthened the police and internal security forces, and demoted or purged officials it deemed sympathetic to the protests.[15] More broadly, the suppression temporarily halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s. Considered a watershed event, the protests also set the limits on political expression in China well into the 21st century. Its memory is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule, and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored political topics in mainland China.", "username": "Panda V4"}

The matchmaking is the single worst matchmaking of any game I've ever played. It will consistently pair you with 0 game complete fresh off the bus noobs and pit you against veteran players with thousands of hours played. I could only stand this rubbish for 60 or so games. There is no semblance of matchmaking. Do not be mistaken. It will just pair you with whoever it can. For some reason this game has tens and hundreds of thousands of players online at any given moment, but it can't find 9 other people across the whole of Europe and even Russia at prime time on a Saturday that are a similar skill level (>30 hours, <100 hours).  \n\nThe amount of Russians that play is unbearable, they are poor teammates and worse enemies. I would estimate at least 80% of them are smurfing. It's pathetic.\n\n\nSprinkled in here and there are good games, but then I stop and think, they probably have a noob who has 3 games played total and the shit I go through is now being inflicted on them.  \n\nIf I had paid for this game, I would've been outraged. It was entertaining for a time but the sheer wonky matchmaking makes the game an absolute chore. There need to be bigger punishments for smurfing. It is essentially cheating. Hardware ban them and ban the main account associated with the smurf too. For me, I would love to play and recommend this game but I can't for two chief reasons - Smurfing and shit matchmaking.", "username": "RockandGrohl"}

My battle pass level for TI7 and TI8 are 5273 and 2616 respectively. I met people in pub games who questioned me or even teased me on \"wasting\" money on all these useless things, with which I could go for a trip to Hawaii or do whatever makes me feel good. However I know, as a free game, dota2 needs supports to maintain and develop, like how a carry needs supports in a match. And I myself, as a software engineer, understand how difficult it is to present the best game to all dota players. So I never hesitated purchasing in this game, which accompanied me all these years, day and night, from a freshman to graduate. Dota has brought me so much happiness, so much fun, and also quite a number of furious times which every player understands. However dota has never dissapointed me, not even once, until I knew kuku and skem are not punished at all from their PUBLIC behaviors of racism in DreamLeague. I feel deeply offended as a Chinese, as well as a dota player, for PUBLICLY tolerating racism in an OFFICIAL game held by Valve. I am feeling too disappointed to support this game, like how a supporter getting disappointed to his/her carry. So I promise I will not spend a single penny on dota2, or other Valve games, unless kuku and skem pay the price for what they did. Please, do respect every single person, every single religion, every single culture, and say no to racism!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n自从2010年玩dota以来，这已经是我守护遗迹的第八个年头了。我TI7和TI8的勇士等级分别是5273和2616. 打路人局的时候我曾经遇到过别的玩家质疑甚至嘲讽我，“干点啥不好非要把这么多钱浪费在没用的东西上”。但是我知道，作为一个免费游戏，dota2是需要支持来运营和开发的，就像carry需要辅助一样。我自己作为一名程序员，也明白想要做最好的游戏的艰辛，所以我在氪金的时候从未犹豫过，为了这个陪我度过了这么多年，日日夜夜，从懵懂新生到毕业的游戏。Dota曾经带给了我诸多欢乐，诸多感动，当然也有不少因为众所周知的原因而自闭的时刻。但是这个游戏从未让我失望，哪怕一次，直到我听说kuku和skem并未因为他们在DreamLeague这样的公开场合的种族主义而受到惩罚。我感到被深深的冒犯了，作为中国人，也作为dota玩家，因为V社在自己的官方赛事上公然容忍了种族主义。现在我觉得非常失望，以至于不想支持这个游戏了，就像一个辅助对carry失望一样。所以我承诺，不会在dota2或者其它V社游戏上再花一分钱，除非kuku和skem为他们的所作所为付出代价。恳请官方，尊重每一个人，每一种信仰，每一样文化，对种族歧视说不！", "username": "Segmentation Fault"}

Will you feel happy playing?\nIf you are Asian, you are called ChingChong, Yellow Monkies. Will you feel happy playing?\nIf you are black, you are called nigger in a game. Will you feel happy play?\n\nIf you are uncomfortable seeing me typing these words in the review, ban me, report me. But remember, there is a pro-player, in a streamed live game, tournament, said the same word to Chinese team, and yet walks free.\n\nYou suck! Valve! I won't apologize until you do anything to Col. Skem.\n\nYou KuKu supporters, Col. Skem supporters, I WISH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY THE BEST LUCK IN CHINA TI.", "username": "JoeyDDD"}

Build-trees in the shop are in-organic and feel clunky. You are left wondering what stats your character needs to build, and which items. The recommended build path is confusing and contains items that you can only buy one or the other of, meaning its useless. Terrain is inconsistent on whether or not you can pass through. Some trees you can hide in, others act like solid terrain. Counterplay with most characters is non-existent, since most things are point and click. You very often get no particle effect or animation to tell you what just hit you or killed you, there are no real skillshots to dodge, only AoE blanked effects. Outplay potential is pretty much non-existant once your opponent is ahead. Awfully designed, overcomplicated for the sake of being overcomplicated, and overall one of the worst MOBA's on the market.

I like the gameplay and all the cheap cosmetics.  I also think they have a great selection of music packs and announcer packs, such as Fallout 4, Darkest Dungeon, and Rick & Morty.  I also like that it is free to play.\n\nNegatives - The community is extremely toxic.  They are not friendly to new players.  They are quick to insult and verbally abuse.  They report you for no reason.  There is no moderation.  While they seem to have some sort of punishment in place, it is extremely unforgiving for new players who misclick.  Even when winning a game by over thirty kills, the team is still rude and unhelpful.  Constructive criticism is unknown to them.  They are impossible to understand, as they reverse what they say minute to minute, just so that they can \"justify\" their verbal abuse.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game.  The toxic community that this game has does not welcome new players, and if it is not going to grow, then the community will only decline until they are kings of nothing.", "username": "Klyngster"}

I would not say I liked it back then but, many friends started playing, so I had no choice. The game updates made the game fresh, and fun even when Ice Frog buffed a hero or nerfed my favourite heroes. I enjoyed most of the games I have played. I still remember the long ranked matches and the silence that they brought to our Teamspeak room. I value the feed moments too. After, two years of playing and reaching almost 1400 hours. My friends and I got bored with the slow updates, or maybe we just had enough with the game. Some of my friends played for almost 6000 hours. I will always remember Dota's moments losing, winning, and feeding. An excellent game to play with friends.", "username": "ゼロツー"}

As the title of the said movie blatantly states, the game is free-to-play. However, there are many optional cosmetic in-game items that one is able to buy within a $5-$15 range (i.e. a crown, sword, shield, etc). The matches are 5 vs 5 players, each with a unique character with their own strengths and weaknesses. No duplicate heroes in a match are allowed.
